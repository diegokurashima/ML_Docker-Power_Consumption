# ML_Docker-Power_Consumption
A simple Machine Learning model deploy with Docker. In this example, the model predicts the PJM East Region (USA) Hourly Power Consumption based on a standard Year, Month, Day and Hour inputs.

The model is based on [Hourly Energy Consumption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption) dataset from kaggle and my study on the database and ML model is available at my [Energy_Consumption-Time_Series_Forecasting_Study](https://github.com/diegokurashima/Energy_Consumption-Time_Series_Forecasting_Study) repository.
